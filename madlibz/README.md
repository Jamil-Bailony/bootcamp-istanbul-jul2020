Mad libs project. See [spec](https://repl.it/@louisrli/recoded-mad-libz)

## Presentation

Your demo will be 10 minutes. We will time it. It's not meant to be a high
pressure situation but we want to make sure that everyone has time to demo in
the allocated time.

### Requirements

Please read these instructions and prepare some thoughts on these for your demo.

* Show us your story and your work. We will go through this quickly, the idea is
  that the chat will just suggest words and parts of speech while you type them,
  then Halit will take a screenshot that we can save as part of our class
  archives.
* Each member will speak **briefly** about one part of the code, maximum of 1 minute per
  person.
  **Remember the requirement that every member must be able to
  to explain any part of the code**. Please think about what you want to say
  beforehand, usually people make it up as they go and it takes too long. I will
  cut you off if it goes longer than a minute, for the sake of having everyone
  present.
* What were the three hardest problems that you faced? One person answers this.
* Reflection: all of the members must speak about what stood out to them
  about their learnings from the project. It can be abstract ("I learned how to
  better find my mistakes") or concrete ("I learned more about the DOM."). 
* Reflection: what do you think is the difference between working on a project
  and working on small exercises?
